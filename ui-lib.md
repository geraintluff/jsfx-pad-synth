```

### `ui_setup(memstart)`

This must be called in `@init`.  It reserves a section of the memory buffer for use by the UI library.  It returns the next index that it is not using.

```
fft_buffer = 0;
fft_buffer_end = fft_buffer + 512;

safe_to_use = ui_setup(fft_buffer_end, 10, 10);

next_array_start = safe_to_use;
```

If you are not using the memory, buffer, then the first argument should be `0`.

## Screen management functions

### `ui_start(defaultScreen)`

This should be the first thing you call.  It resets the viewport, does some error-checking, detects clicks - generally important. :)

If the screen is not set, it is set to `defaultScreen`.

### `ui_screen()`

Gets the current screen ID.  You should check this to see what you should be drawing:

```
ui_start("main"); // Default screen

ui_screen() == "main" ? (
	...
) : ui_system();
```

Although there is a string in the above example, screen IDs are always compared numerically.  However, two identical string literals will be represented by the same numerical ID, it's a nice readable way to get a set of unique IDs.

You must *always* perform the `ui_screen()` check, even if you only have one screen, so that `ui_system()` can be used to display errors etc.

There are some built-in screen IDs which are handled by ui_system();

### `ui_screen_level()`

Returns how many screens are below this one in the stack

### `ui_system()`

This is the fallback function you must call if you have not rendered a screen.  It displays errors and other built-in screens.

You should always have this - since JSFX has no exceptions or error-handling, this is way you'll be informed if you tell the UI to do something nonsensical.

### `ui_screen_get(index)` and `ui_screen_set(index, value)`

Gets/sets the current screen argument at index `index`.

This is how screens can "call" each other with arguments.  You need a convention agreed between the screens about what the arguments are.  When a screen is opened, all arguments are set to 0.

```
ui_screen_open("say-hello");
ui_screen_set(0, "world");
ui_screen_set(1, 42);
```

If you want the screen to give you a result to a non-fixed location, then you need to pass in an array.  For example, a "integer-prompt" screen might take two arguments as the range, and the other as the memory index ("array") where the result should be placed.

```
// A text variable you're interested in
myarray[0] = 5; // default value

ui_screen_open("integer-prompt");
ui_screen_set(0, 1);
ui_screen_set(1, 10);
ui_screen_set(2, myarray);
```

## Viewport and stack operations

All drawing parameters (including the viewport, colours and alignment) are stored in a "stack".  Generally, you will made a modification that pushes a change onto the stack, and then pop it off afterwards.

Some operations (such as the `ui_split_*()` functions) both modify the existing level on the stack, *and* push a new layer to it.  This is often convenient - for example, if your UI has a side-bar, you can use `ui_split_right(100)` to push it onto the stack and draw within it, but when you `ui_pop()` afterwards, you are left with the *remaining* area (that is, the viewport has now shrunk so it doesn't include the side-bar).

### `ui_left()`, `ui_right()`, `ui_top()`, `ui_bottom()`, `ui_width()` and `ui_height()`

These return the dimensions of the current viewport - very useful if you need to draw your own stuff and want to know what the viewport is.

### `ui_pop()` (and `ui_push()`)

Pop a layer off the stack, or push a new layer (identical to the current one).

You probably don't need to use `ui_push()` directly - instead, many of the other functions call `ui_push()` as a side-effect.

### `ui_split_top(height)`, `ui_split_bottom(height)`, `ui_split_left(width)` and `ui_split_right(width)`

These perform two actions:

* Push a new layer onto the stack, with the viewport attached to the appropriate side
* Modify the existing layer (now second on the stack) so that it no longer includes the new section.

It's called "split" because the two layers on the stack are now non-overlapping.

```
ui_split_bottom(100);
	ui_fill(0, 128, 0);
	ui_text("footer");
ui_pop();
// Viewport is now everything *except* the footer
ui_fill(0, 0, 0); // Does not overwrite the footer
```

### `ui_split_topratio(ratio)`, etc.

These are the same as `ui_split_top()` etc., except instead of a pixel height you specify a ratio of the current viewport width/height.

The return value of this function is the calculated height/width.

### `ui_split_toptext(text)`, etc.

These are the same as `ui_split_top()` etc., except it measures the supplied text, plus some amount of padding.  This is a useful way to get a default height/width for buttons and controls.

(If you pass an empty string to `ui_split_toptext()` or `ui_split_bottomtext()`, it will still return a minimum height of one line (plus padding), but there is no minimum width for `ui_split_lefttext()` or `ui_split_righttext()`.  However, measuring the empty string has some odd side-effects, so it's best to actually provide some text.)

The return value of this function is the calculated height/width.

### `ui_split_next()`

Pop a layer off the stack, and perform the same split again.  This can be used with `ui_split_*ratio()` to divide the space up evenly:

```
ui_split_topratio(1/3);
	ui_text('Line 1');
ui_split_next();
	ui_text('Line 2');
ui_split_next();
	ui_text('Line 3');
ui_pop();
```

Calling `ui_split_n()` when the current layer was not created by `ui_split_*()` results in an error.

### `ui_push_height(height)` and `ui_push_width(width)`

Push a new alignment state to the stack with the specified height/width, using the current alignment.

### `ui_push_heightratio(ratio)` and `ui_push_widthratio(ratio)`

Like `ui_push_height(height)` and `ui_push_width(width)`, but specifying a proportion of the height/width;

The return value of this function is the calculated height/width.

### `ui_push_heighttext(text)` and `ui_push_widthtext(text)`

Like `ui_push_height(height)` and `ui_push_width(width)`, but measures the supplied text, plus some amount of padding.

Similarly to `ui_split_toptext()` and `ui_split_bottomtext()`, if you pass in an empty string, it will still return the minimum height of one line (plus padding).  There is no minimum width for `ui_push_width

The return value of this function is the calculated height/width.

### `ui_push_above(height)`, `ui_push_below(height)`, `ui_push_leftof(width)` and `ui_push_rightof(width)`

These functions are the counterparts of `ui_push_height()` and `ui_push_width()` to a certain extent.  They push a new viewport that is above/below/left/right of the viewport that would be produced by `ui_push_width()` or `ui_push_height()`.

This lets you position content using `ui_push_height()` and `ui_push_width()` or other means, and then fit other content around that.  `ui_push_above()` and `ui_push_below()` can also be useful when used after `ui_wraptext()`, which again returns the height of the wrapped text.

### `ui_push_aboveratio(ratio)`, `ui_push_abovetext(text)`, etc.

You should by this point be able to guess what these functions do. :)

### `ui_pad()`

`ui_pad()` pads by a default amount in each direction.  This amount can be set using `ui_padding()`.

### `ui_padleft()`, `ui_padright()`, `ui_padtop()` and `ui_padbottom()`

Pads in one direction only, with the default padding.

### `ui_pad1(pixels)`, `ui_pad2(xpixels, ypixels)`, `ui_pad4(left, top, right, bottom)`

This insets the current viewport by an appropriate amount in each direction.  The three numbered variants are for different numbers of arguments.  If any of the padding values is a negative number, the default padding for that direction is used.

It does *not* change the stack.

### `ui_padding(hpadding, vpadding);`

This sets the default padding for each direction.  If you supply a negative number for either, the padding in that direction is unchanged.

## Graphics

These do not add or remove anything to the stack.  Instead, they modify the current drawing layer (and any later layers that inherit from it).

### `ui_color(r, g, b)`

Sets the current colour, full opacity.  RGB values are in the 0-255 range.

### `ui_colora(r, g, b, a)`

Sets the current colour, variable opacity.  RGB values are in the 0-255 range, but opacity is 0-1.

### `ui_color_refresh()`

Ensures that the current raw colour settings (`gfx_*` variables) match the current colour.  You only need this if you are drawing things yourself, and you do not need to call this if you have just called `ui_color()`.

### `ui_fontsize(pixels)`, `ui_fontbold(isBold)`, `ui_fontitalic(isItalic)` and `ui_fontface(name)`

Changes properties of the font.  These changes have immediate effect.

The UI library always uses font index 16, so it is recommended that you avoid this in custom drawing code.  If you make changes to this font index, then the UI system might not notice, and will draw incorrectly.  However, if you use a different font index, the UI system checks this before drawing text and will reset.

### `ui_font(name, size, isBold, isItalic)`

Composite function for the above operations.  If `-1` is supplied to either `name` or `size`, it re-uses the current font name/size.

### `ui_font_refresh()`

This ensures that the current raw font settings (`gfx_setfont()`) match the font values.  You only need this if you are drawing things yourself (e.g. using `gfx_drawstr()`), and you do not need to call this if you've just called `ui_font()`.  This also calls `ui_color_refresh()`.

### `ui_align(halign, valign)`

Some operations (like text) need a horizontal/vertical alignment.  These are numbers between 0 and 1 representing the alignment - so `0` means "left" or "top", `0.5` is "centre", and `1` is "right" or "bottom".

The default alignment is `(0.5, 0.5)`, which is the middle.

### `ui_text(string)`

Renders a string aligned within the current element.

Returns the width of the rendered text;

### `ui_text_width(string)` and `ui_text_height(string)`

String width and height using the current font settings.

### `ui_wraptext(string)`

Renders wrapped text (breaks on whitespace), aligned within the current element.

Returns height of the rendered text.

### `ui_wraptext_height(string)`

Height of wrapped text using the current font settings.

### `ui_fill()`

Fills the current viewport with the current colour.

## Input

### `ui_mouse_x()` and `ui_mouse_y()`

Mouse position relative to current viewport.

### `ui_mouse_xratio()` and `ui_mouse_yratio()`

Mouse position as proportion of current viewport.  If the mouse is outside the current viewport, this value will be outside of the range 0-1.

### `ui_mouse_down()`

Returns whether the mouse was just pressed inside the current viewport.

### `ui_mouse_down_outside()`

Returns whether the mouse was just pressed outside the current viewport.

### `ui_mouse_up()`

Returns whether the mouse was just released inside the current viewport.

#### `ui_click_clear()`

You probably shouldn't have overlapping click regions - but if you do you can use `ui_click_clear()` to stop later code from detecting it.  No mouse-related functions will return true in later code.

### `ui_hover()`

Whether the mouse is currently inside the viewport.

Note: this returns true even if the mouse buttons are down or the user has clicked somewhere else and is dragging.

### `ui_press()`

Whether the mouse was originally clicked within this viewport, the button is still down and the user is hovering over this element.  It returns the time since the mouse was originally clicked.

Note: if the user holds the mouse down and drags outside the control and then back into it, this will return true.

### `ui_click()`

Whether this element was clicked.  It returns the duration of the click.

Note: this triggers on mouse-up (which also means that drag and press will return false at this point).  If you want mouse-down, use `ui_mousedown()`.

### `ui_clickcount()`

Returns whether the latest click was a single-click, double-click, etc.

```
ui_click() ? (
	ui_clickcount == 1 ? (
		single_click_action();
	) : ui_clickcount == 2 ? (
		double_click_action();
	);
);
```

### `ui_drag()`

Whether this element was clicked before and the mouse is still down.  It returns the time since the mouse was originally clicked.

## Complex controls

These are controls implemented using the above functions.  They are opinionated - they have fixed colours and layouts.  However, they can be used to create a powerful UI more easily.

There are also some pre-defined screens which are made available if you use `control_system()` instead of `ui_system()`:

*	`control.prompt` - first argument is a 

### `control_navbar(title, next_screen, next_title)`

Displays a navigation bar for the screen with a centred title, and "back" button if the screen is not top-level.  If `next_screen` is supplied, it displays a button on the right-hand side for navigating to the next page.

### `control_button(text)`

Displays a button with text, and returns `true` if the button has just been clicked.

```
control_button("Go!") ? (
	do_something();
);
```

### `control_indicator_button(text, enabled)`

Displays a button that can be disabled (greyed-out).

```
control_button("Go!", is_enabled) ? (
	is_enabled ? do_something();
);
```

Note that it will still return positive when clicked, even if the button is disabled, so you should check again before performing an action.

### `control_selector(value, text, up_value, down_value)`

Displays a control with up/down buttons and a text area.  Returns the new value.

```
// Displays a control that changes between foo/bar/baz
display_text = value == 1 ? "foo" : value == 2 ? "bar" : "baz";
value = control_selector(value, display_text, (value + 1)%3, (value + 2)%3);
```

### `control_hslider(value, range_low, range_high, curve_bias)`

Displays a horizontal slider.  Returns the new value.

The value of `curve_bias` determines how the displayed proportion of the slider corresponds to the actual values. `0` is linear, and you can get a logarithmic scale using `log(high/low)`:

```
// Linear slider between 0 and 1
value = control_hslider(value, 0, 1, 0);

// Low-biased slider (better accuracy near 0)
value = control_hslider(value, 0, 1, 3);

// High-biased slider (better accuracy near 1)
value = control_hslider(value, 0, 1, -3);

// Logarithmic slider
value = control_hslider(value, low, high, log(high/low));
```

### `control_system()`

This is a replacement for

### Drawing functions

These functions are used to make the above controls, so you can use them if you wish to match this look with custom elements.  There are three states:

*	`enabled` - used by buttons and the active part of sliders
*	`disabled` - used by disabled buttons
*	`inset` - used for meters/displays, and the inactive part of sliders

There are three functions for each of these states:

*	`control_color_fill_{state}()` - sets the colour to the appropriate background colour, ready to call `ui_fill()`
*	`control_color_text_{state}()` - sets the colour to the appropriate text colour, ready to call `ui_text()`
*	`control_finish_{state}(strength)` - adds gloss/shadows to the element. Strength should be `1` unless you want it deliberately flatter.

Although these functions form a nice set when used together (in the order fill, text, finish), they can be used for any - for example, the

If an element comprises multiple states (e.g. sliders which have an `enabled` element on top of an `inset` groove), it is recommended to draw `inset` first, and then either `enabled` or `disabled` on top.

```
// Custom element, with an "enabled" section sitting inside an "inset" groove
ui_push();
	control_color_fill_inset();
	ui_fill();
	control_finish_inset();
	
	control_color_fill_enabled();
	ui_push_widthratio(0.5); // Fill half the width
		ui_fill();
		control_finish_enabled();
	ui_pop();
ui_pop();
```

NOTE: the `control_color_*_*()` functions use the current mouse hover/click/drag state to decide on the colour.  Since the regions for checking that state depend on the viewport, you probably want to assign these colours *before* changing the viewport - see `control_color_fill_enabled()` in the above example.

#### `control_border()`

Draws a border around the element.  Used for the outside of interactive controls, but not for internal boundaries.

#### `control_arrow(direction)`

Draws an arrow aligned towards one edge of the element (it is *not* centred).

Values for `direction` are `0` (left), `1` (top), `2` (right) and `3` (bottom).
